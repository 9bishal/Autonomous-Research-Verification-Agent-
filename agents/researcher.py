====================
AGENT 2 — The Researcher

WHAT IT DOES:
  Takes the 4-6 subtasks from the Orchestrator and searches the web
  for each one using Tavily. All searches run in PARALLEL — so 5
  searches take the same time as 1.

IMPRESSIVE FEATURE — PARALLEL EXECUTION:
  Uses Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to run all Tavily searches
  at the same time. This is a key performance pattern in
  production AI systems.

  Sequential  → 5 searches × 3s each = 15 seconds
  Parallel    → 5 searches run together = ~3 seconds

HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HR:
  "The Researcher searches the web for each subtask in parallel
   using ThreadPoolExecutor. This cuts research time from 15 seconds
   to 3 seconds. In production systems, I/O-bound tasks like API calls
   should always run concurrently — this is a standard engineering
   pattern that shows I think about performance, not just correctness."

Input  → state["subtasks"]
Output → state["raw_research"]  (list of {subtask, sources})
