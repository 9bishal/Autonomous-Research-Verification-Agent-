======================
AGENT 1 — The Orchestrator

WHAT IT DOES:
  Takes the user's research topic and breaks it into 4-6 focused
  subtasks. Every other agent works from these subtasks.

WHY IT EXISTS:
  A single search query like "AI in healthcare" returns generic results.
  But breaking it into focused questions like:
    - "What are the latest FDA-approved AI diagnostic tools?"
    - "How is AI reducing hospital readmission rates?"
  ...gives specific, deep, cross-referenced research.

  This is exactly what a research team lead does before assigning work.

HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HR:
  "The Orchestrator is the team lead. It reads the topic and creates
   a research plan — 4 to 6 specific subtasks. Every downstream agent
   works from this plan. This mirrors how real research projects work:
   you don't research everything at once, you decompose the problem first."

Input  → state["topic"]
Output → state["subtasks"]  (list of 4-6 research questions)
