THE LANGGRAPH WORKFLOW — Wires all 5 agents + HITL gate

FULL PIPELINE FLOW:
  START
    │
    ▼
  Orchestrator      ← breaks topic into 5 subtasks
    │
    ▼
  Researcher        ← parallel Tavily searches (one per subtask)
    │
    ▼
  Analyst           ← extracts structured insights from raw results
    │
    ▼
  ⏸ INTERRUPT ←──── PIPELINE PAUSES HERE
  Human Review      ← human approves/rejects insights in Streamlit UI
    │
    ▼ (if approved)
  Writer            ← compiles professional report from insights
    │
    ▼
  Fact Checker      ← validates every claim against sources
    │
    ▼
  END

THE HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP PATTERN:
  LangGraph supports HITL via interrupt_before=[node_name].
  When the graph hits that node, execution PAUSES.
  The full state is saved by MemorySaver.
  The Streamlit UI shows the insights to the user.
  When the user clicks Approve, the app updates state
  (human_approved=True) and calls graph.invoke() again.
  LangGraph resumes from exactly where it paused.

HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HR:
  "The pipeline uses LangGraph's interrupt_before mechanism to pause
   execution after the Analyst runs. The state is fully preserved —
   nothing is lost. When the human approves, the graph resumes from
   the exact checkpoint. This is the same pattern used in Anthropic's
   Claude and other production AI systems that require human oversight
   at critical decision points."
